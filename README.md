# LinkedIn Agent

## High Level Goal

To be able to create posts on LinkedIn about new innovations in the AI space around evals, testing, and quality in general. 

## Plan

This project will involve a few systems:

1. A way of scraping the latest cutting edge research in this space
2. An LLM that can understand all these new papers
3. An AI agent that will generate posts to put on LinkedIn
4. Some prompt engineering so those posts are written in my preferred way

## Tech

This project will lean heavily on langchain, using OpenAI and ChromaDB.
